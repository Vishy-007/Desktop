    <p>Leopards are powerful, adaptable ambush predators known for their solitary nature and exceptional climbing
        abilities. They are typically nocturnal, hunting at dusk and dawn, and are highly skilled swimmers. Leopards
        often carry their kills up into trees to protect them from scavengers, and their camouflage allows them to blend
        seamlessly with their surroundings</p>
    <p id="para">Leopards are primarily nocturnal, with their hunting activities taking place primarily during the
        night. Their large eyes and dilated pupils allow them to see well in the dark, and they are known for their
        ability to ambush prey. Leopards use a variety of calls, including harsh coughs, throaty growls, and purring
        sounds, to communicate</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Leopards are found in a wide range of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and mountains.
        They are able to adapt to various climates, from the hot, humid tropics to the colder, drier regions. Their
        solitary nature means they often establish territories and defend them through scent marking and other behaviors
